## 1. Hierarchy of Programming Languages

Understanding the abstraction levels of code is the first step in computer science.

### Machine Language
* **Definition:** The native language of the CPU.
* **Format:** Instructions represented in **Binary Code** (0s and 1s).
* **Characteristics:** Extremely difficult for humans to read, but directly executable by hardware.

###  Low-Level Languages (Assembly)
* **Definition:** A slight abstraction over machine code.
* **Characteristics:** Very close to the computer's hardware architecture. Used for driver development and system optimization.

###  High-Level Languages
* **Definition:** Languages designed to be easily read and written by humans.
* **Examples:** Python, JavaScript, C++.
* **Characteristics:** Uses English-like syntax and abstracts away memory management.

## 2. Execution Models: Compiler vs. Interpreter

How does the computer understand our code? It depends on the language type.

| Type            | Process                                                                  | Key Characteristic                                           |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compiled**    | Translates the **entire** code into machine language *before* execution. | Faster execution, but requires a build step (e.g., C++).     |
| **Interpreted** | Translates and executes the code **line by line** in real-time.          | Easier to debug and test rapidly (e.g., Python, JavaScript). |

## 3. Programming Paradigms

Paradigms are different "styles" or ways of organizing code.

* **Structured Programming:** Code is executed in a logical sequence. It relies on blocks, loops, and subroutines.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Code is organized around "Objects" (data) rather than just logic. This is essential for modern software development.

## 4. Core Logic Concepts

### Algorithm
A finite set of instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a problem.
* **Structure:** Algorithms are built using three building blocks:
    1.  **Sequences:** Step-by-step execution.
    2.  **Decisions (Conditionals):** Choosing a path based on logic (True/False).
    3.  **Cycles (Loops):** Repeating actions efficiently.

### Pseudocode
A high-level description of an algorithm.
* **Purpose:** It is not real executable code. It is a tool for humans to plan the logic before writing the actual syntax.
* **Benefit:** Simplifies complex problems by focusing on the *solution* rather than the syntax rules.

### Flowchart
A graphical representation of an algorithm.
* **Purpose:** Allows you to visualize the step-by-step flow of the solution.
* **Usage:** Essential for debugging logic errors before writing code.
