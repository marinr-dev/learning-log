## Writing the First Algorithm
The "Hello World" program is the traditional starting point to verify that the development environment is set up correctly.

### Example: "Hola Mundo" Console Output
The following algorithm demonstrates the basic structure of a PSeInt program and uses the `Escribir` command to send text to the console.

> **Pro Tip:** Use the shortcut `Ctrl + N` to quickly create a new file in PSeInt.

## Visualizing Logic: Flowcharts
A powerful feature of PSeInt is the ability to generate a visual representation of the algorithm's logic. In English, this is called a **Flowchart**.

### Viewing the Flowchart
Click the diagram icon in the toolbar to generate the flowchart for the current algorithm.

This visual aid is crucial for understanding how the program's execution flows sequentially from "Algoritmo" to "FinAlgoritmo".
